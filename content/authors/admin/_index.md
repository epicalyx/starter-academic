I am currently pursuing research at the intersection of Gender, Healthcare and Technology as a [graduate research student](http://citapp.3it.in/students/taru-jain/) at [International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), with the supervision of [Prof. Preeti Mudliar](https://preetimudliar.work/). My primary research area of focus is understanding *Communication Patterns and Management of Enigmatic Menstrual Health Conditions in India*, and I have been conducting qualitative research studies for the same since the past 6 months. 

Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech in Information Technology and have worked as a Machine Learning Research Intern at various places like [MIDAS-IIITD](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) and [Omdena](https://omdena.com/), where I contributed to projects based on computational social science, computer vision and healthcare.
